The Catena-X AAS proxy is a library (and service) for interacting with federated and semantically-annotated Catena-X data components in a convenient fashion.

It makes use of the [Asset Administration Shell](http://admin-shell-io.com/) specification for
discovering and accessing (data, service) assets associated to digital twins (such as vehicles, serialized parts, production batches, ...).

It uses an attached [International Dataspace (IDS) Connector](https://internationaldataspaces.org/) for securely and privately exchanging sovereign and sensible data.

It relies on the [Semantic Framework](https://confluence.catena-x.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=25199158) 
to deal with authentication, validation, federation and IDS-specific implementation issues.

### Configuration:

This service/library is deployed on purpose/demand, so there is yet no fixed container or deployment 
configuration.

### Build Package:

Run `mvn install` to run unit tests, build and install the package (and submodules)

### Build & Run Package Locally:

Run `./run_local.sh` to run the aas proxy locally (against the dev042 central aas registry)

Since the central semantic services currently use the CX-Portal oauth2/openid domain, you
need to create a bearer token.

This can be arranged through using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) with the [Catena-X Postman Collection](../../catenax.postman_collection.json).
In the 'Semantic Layer' folder, we have preconfigured a respective Oauth2 callback for which you will need to set
the variable '{{auth_url}}' in the environment, e.g. to
'https://catenaxdev042akssrv.germanywestcentral.cloudapp.azure.com/iamcentralidp/auth/realms/CX-Central/protocol/openid-connect'

An alternative is to login to the [Catena-X portal](https://catenaxdev042aksportal.germanywestcentral.cloudapp.azure.com) and
access the bearer token through the Javascript debugging console.

Run 'curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:4243/semantics/registry/shell-descriptors?page=0&pageSize=10' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer ${BEARER_TOKEN}'
'

to route a discovery call through the proxy to central.
